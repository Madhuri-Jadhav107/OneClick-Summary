# 📊 Smart Meeting Assistant – Dashboard Module

This document describes the **React Dashboard** used in the *Smart Meeting Assistant with Text Summarization and Action Tracker* project.  
The dashboard is built using **React (Antigravity)** and secured using **Firebase Authentication**.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security Overview

### Authentication Method
- **Firebase Authentication** (Email/Password, Google Sign-In)
- Token management is handled automatically by the Firebase SDK
- User session persists via `localStorage` / IndexedDB (Firebase default)

### Why Firebase?
- Robust, secure identity management
- Easy integration with Firestore (NoSQL database)
- Real-time capabilities

---

## 🧑 User Identity Management

### `user_id` (uid)
- Generated by **Firebase** at signup
- Unique identifier for the user (`user.uid`)
- Used to secure access to meeting data

### User Profile
- Additional user details are stored in **Cloud Firestore** under the `users` collection.
- Document ID matches the Auth `uid`.

Example User Document (`users/{uid}`):
```json
{
  "email": "user@company.com",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "company_id": "company_101",
  "role": "user",
  "created_at": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```
